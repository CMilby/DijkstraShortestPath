Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
==================================
Wanting to try to implement DSPA, I looked for visual examples to see how it actually worked. Unable to find some I decided to make my own visual example.
##How It Works
Left Click: This will use the current tool that is selected  
Middle Click: Unhighlight all highighted nodes  
##Tools
+ Node Creator: Creates a new node  
+ Edge Creator: Selected two nodes and create an edge between them then prompted to set weight for edge  
+ Start Point Creator: Choose the start point for the algorithm  
+ End Point Creator: Choose the end point for the algorithm  
+ Eraser: Erase a node or edge  
+ Run: Run DSPA and print the shortest path to the console  
Other Tools include turning Node and Edge names on and off
